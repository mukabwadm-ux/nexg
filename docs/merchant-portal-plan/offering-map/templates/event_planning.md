[All categories](../README.md) / [Field library](../field-library.md) / [Customer display rules](../customer-display.md)

## Customer presentation

The browse card uses name, accurate media, a short summary, an accurately labelled price/quote state and actual availability where known.

Additional card highlights: Event type and package scope; Guest range and supported locations.

The detail page groups the specifications below. Choice, sizing, price, fulfilment and terms sections appear only where applicable.

- REQUEST_QUOTE: Submit a private request or provider handoff; clearly show pending response rather than a confirmed reservation.

This extends the existing offering schema definitions REQUEST_QUOTE_V1. It does not activate any model.
